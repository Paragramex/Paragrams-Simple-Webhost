# Paragrams-Simple-Webhost
A small webhost suited for friends ect. This webhost has an admin panel and each new user will automatically make a new directory that can only be accessed by that user and the admin. 

Note, I dont hae a lot of dcumentation as this project is not done and fyi it is not secure. Refer to the license for use as I claim no liability and I do NOT want people to just rebrand my project without credit. That is illegal and immoral and although we all make mistakes, skidding code off of a pubic github repo with a license is not cool.

## Changelog coming soon :)
